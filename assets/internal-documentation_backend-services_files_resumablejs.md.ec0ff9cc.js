This is done by splitting each files into small chunks; whenever the upload of a chunk fails, uploading is retried until the procedure completes. This allows uploads to automatically resume uploading after a network connection is lost either locally or to the server. Additionally, it allows for users to pause, resume and even recover uploads without losing state.</p><p>Resumable.js does not have any external dependencies other the <code>HTML5 File API</code>. This is relied on for the ability to chunk files into smaller pieces. Currently, this means that support is limited to Firefox 4+ and Chrome 11+.</p><h2 id="what-resumable-js-does" tabindex="-1">What Resumable.js does <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-resumable-js-does" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>In Frontend side resumable split the file in multiple small chunks.
